## VIRTEX 2 Geometry Summary (XC2VP20-FG676):
#	4 Slices per CLB, 2 TBUFs per CLB
#	2 LUTs per Slice, 2 FDs per Slice (share common RST/CE/CLK)
#	2 Fast Carry MUXCYs per Slice, plus 1 Fast ORCY
#	1 MUXF5 and 1 MUXFx per Slice (x=6,7 or 8)
#
# For "Normal" Coords (x,y) Slices, TBUFs, RAMBs, etc all have
#	independent coordinate origins, so use GRID coords if
#	you must combine diffferent types of components.
#	Component coordinate ranges:
#		SLICE  x0y0 to x91y111
#		TBUF   x0y0 to x90y111, even x only
#		RAMB16 x0y0 to x7y13 (88 total)
#		GT     x0y0 to x3y1  (8 total)
#		DCM    x0y0 to x3y1  (8 total)
#		MULT18X18 x0y0 to x7y13 (88 total)
#
# In GRID Coords (X,Y) bottom left is X3Y4, top right is X138Y227
#	X value cycles through SLICE-TBUF-SPECIAL with increasing X
# 		-X3Y4 is a SLICE, so is X138Y227
#		-SPECIAL is RAMB/MULT or GT or DCM
#		-SPECIAL only exists at X=8,26,44,62,80,98,116,134
#		   RAMB/MULT exist at all these X locations
#		   GTs at X=26,62,80,116  .and.  Y=19,227
#		   DCMs at X=8,44,98,134  .and.  Y=3,231
#	Y values are continuous for Slices, except for PPC holes
#		-TBUFs are only even in Y (2 per CLB)
#		-RAMBs are spaced 16 apart in Y,
#		   starting at Y=35 on GT columns, Y=19 otherwise
#		   (GTs effectively take up a RAMB spot)
#		-MULTs are 1 lower in Y than RAMB (at Y_RAMB - 1)
#
# PPC "Dead Zone" holes:
#    No TBUFS from x14y40 to x58y71   .and.   x62y40 to x76y71
#	    GRID:  X23Y88 to X47Y143  .and.  X95Y88 to X119Y143
