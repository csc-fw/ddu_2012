NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

WARNING:Place:206 - This design contains an RPM macro for which a specific
   alignment on the CLB grid was desired. The macro can not be aligned in this

The reason for this issue is the following:
This structured logic must be aligned in a specific way on the CLB grid. In this
case, the logic is locked to a position that has not this specific alignment.
The problem was found with SLICE $1I162/$6I4479/DIN9 that is locked to site
SLICE_X4Y21.

WARNING:Place - 
   The structured logic associated with a carry chain could not be placed in
   such a way as to use all of the fast carry connections due to a placement

   be satisfactory and that the resulting performance is acceptable.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

WARNING:Place - 
   The structured logic associated with a carry chain could not be placed in
   such a way as to use all of the fast carry connections due to a placement
   constraint.  A sub optimal placement will be performed which may result in
   timing errors. You will need to verify that this sub-optimal placement will
   be satisfactory and that the resulting performance is acceptable.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

case, the logic is locked to a position that has not this specific alignment.

WARNING:Place - 
   The structured logic associated with a carry chain could not be placed in
   such a way as to use all of the fast carry connections due to a placement
   constraint.  A sub optimal placement will be performed which may result in
   timing errors. You will need to verify that this sub-optimal placement will
   be satisfactory and that the resulting performance is acceptable.

The following components are involved in this logic:
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q0

This situation can be resolved by fixing at least one of the following 2

The structured logic could not be placed in the relative placement form
required.  This is due to the fact that the component $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q2
is already contained in an rpm that will not allow the logic to be placed in the
legal form.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

The reason for this issue is the following:
This structured logic must be aligned in a specific way on the CLB grid. In this
case, the logic is locked to a position that has not this specific alignment.
The problem was found with SLICE $1I162/$4I4399/DIN9 that is locked to site
SLICE_X4Y85. 
WARNING:Place - 
   The structured logic associated with a carry chain could not be placed in
   such a way as to use all of the fast carry connections due to a placement
   constraint.  A sub optimal placement will be performed which may result in
   timing errors. You will need to verify that this sub-optimal placement will
   be satisfactory and that the resulting performance is acceptable.

The following components are involved in this logic:
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q0
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q2
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q4
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q6
  SLICE $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q8
This situation can be resolved by fixing at least one of the following 2
issues:
The structured logic could not be placed in the relative placement form
required.  This is due to the fact that the component $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q2
is already contained in an rpm that will not allow the logic to be placed in the
legal form.  

The structured logic could not be placed in the relative placement form
required.  This is due to the fact that the component $1I162/$1I4156/$2I4236/Q4
is already contained in an rpm that will not allow the logic to be placed in the
legal form.
