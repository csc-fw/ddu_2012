WARNING:Place - 
   The structured logic associated with a carry chain could not be placed in
   such a way as to use all of the fast carry connections due to a placement
   constraint.  A sub optimal placement will be performed which may result in
   timing errors. You will need to verify that this sub-optimal placement will
   be satisfactory and that the resulting performance is acceptable.
